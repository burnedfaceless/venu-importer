## About  
Venue importer is an add on for The Events Calendar plugin. This plugin integrates with the Google Places API and imports places as venues. Once imported, the plugin registers a Cron job that will run on occasion to check the Venues you have imported for data changes.

## Setup
The first thing you will need to do is obtain a Google Places API Key.
